## Dataset
This dataset is published by Department for Transport, UK. It contains road accidents data in 2016.
Dataset is avilable in "dftRoadSafety_Accidents_2016". All the data variables are coded rather than containing textual 
strings. The lookup tables are available in the "Road-Accident-Safety-Data-Guide.xls".

## Motivation
With the information such as location details, road conditions, weather conditions, can we predict accident severity 
so that emergency services can be better prepared in case of accidents. 
Additionally this model can help identify the situations which are accident prone and alert the drivers to be more 
cautious
